# Gzir bot
This small project helps to get notified in case of utility interruptions in users area.<br>
It scrapes [veolias site](https://interactive.vjur.am/) and [ENAs site](https://www.ena.am/Info.aspx?id=5) periodically and notifies users if there are any utility interruptions in telegram.<br>
To get notified, users should search for [@gzirbot](https://t.me/gzirbot) in telegram and follow the instructions.<br>
 
### For those who would like to check out the codes
I know this is not the best code ever.<br>
But hey, this is my first python project ok? I started it mainly to **learn** python.<br>
You are welcome to add some comments with suggestions, constructive feedback or to open pull requests to improve the code and architecture quality.
