# Gzir bot
This small project helps to get notified in case of utility interruptions in users area.<br>
It scrapes [veolias site](https://interactive.vjur.am/) periodically and notifies users if there are any water interruptions in telegram.<br>
To get notified, users should search for [@gzirbot](https://t.me/gzirbot) in telegram and follow the instructions.<br>
 
### For those who would like to check out the codes
I know this is probably not the best code.<br>
But hey, this is my first python project ok? I started it mainly to **learn** python.<br>
However, you are welcome to add some comments with suggestions, constructive feedback or to open pull requests to improve the code and architecture quality.
